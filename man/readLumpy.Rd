\title{Read in the structural variations predicted by Lumpy}

\description{
    Reading the structural variations predicted by Lumpy, 
    filtering low quality predictions and merging overlapping predictions.
}

\usage{
    readLumpy(file="", regSizeLowerCutoff=100, readsSupport=3, 
              method="Lumpy", regSizeUpperCutoff=1000000, 
              breakpointThres=200, scoreCut=0.1, ...)
}

\arguments{
    \item{file}{the file containing the prediction results of Lumpy.}
    \item{regSizeLowerCutoff}{the minimum size for a structural variation 
                              to be read.}
    \item{regSizeUpperCutoff}{the maximum size for a structural variation 
                              to be read.}
    \item{readsSupport}{the minimum read pair support for a structural variation 
                              to be read.} 
    \item{method}{a tag to assign to the result of this function.}
    \item{breakpointThres}{a threshold to remove SVs with breakpoint with 
                           too large interval.}
    \item{scoreCut}{predictions with score larger than this threshold will
                    be discarded.}
    \item{...}{parameters passed to read.table.}
}

\details{
    The predicted SVs could be further filtered by the number of reads 
    supporting the occurence of a specific SV, and the predicted size of 
    SVs to get more reliable SVs. See our paper for more details.
}

\value{
    A list with the following components:

    \item{del}{the deletions predicted by Lumpy.}
    \item{dup}{the duplications predicted by Lumpy.}
    \item{inv}{the inversions predicted by Lumpy.}
}
